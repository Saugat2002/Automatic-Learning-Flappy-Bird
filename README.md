## Flappy Bird: A Visual Exploration with PyOpenGL

### About
This project focuses on showcasing the capabilities of PyOpenGL to create a dynamic and engaging game environment. While the original Flappy Bird game is 2D, this project takes it to the next dimension, introducing depth and perspective to the gameplay.

### Features
* **3D Environment:** The game world is rendered in 3D, offering a more immersive and visually appealing experience.
* **Realistic Physics:** The bird's flight and the obstacles' movements are simulated using basic physics principles for a more authentic feel.
* **Dynamic Lighting:** The game incorporates lighting effects to create depth and atmosphere, enhancing the overall visual appeal.
* **Camera Control:** Users can manipulate the camera angle to explore the 3D environment from different perspectives.
* **Interactive Elements:** The project includes interactive elements such as adjustable difficulty levels, camera controls, and potentially even multiplayer modes.

### Requirements
* Python (version 3.6 or higher)
* PyOpenGL
* NumPy
* Other graphics-related libraries (as needed)

### Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Saugat2002/Automatic-Learning-Flappy-Bird.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd FlappyBird-Q-Learning
   ```

3. To see the performance of the agent after it has learned, simply run the 'Flappy_Bird.py' file:
   ```
   python Flappy_Bird.py
   ```

4. To play it yourself:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
